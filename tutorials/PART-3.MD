## Part 3: Test your dApp and join us at Motoko Bootcamp for a full week of learning!
> In this last part, we'll verify that your dApp works as expected. To do that, we'll use a canister that has already been deployed to the Internet Computer. This canister will interact with your own and verify that the functions you've written work as expected. Let's go! 

### What are inter-canisters calls?
One of the most exciting aspect of the Internet Computer is the ability for canisters to easily communicate with each other. To achieve the vision of the Internet Computer, services (i.e canisters) needs to be able to call each other and interoperate with each others. This enables us to reuse the services that we've built and to build more complex services by combining existing ones, or leveraging canisters from other developers.

In this last part, we'll learn how to perfom our first inter-canister call, as you will call the **Test** canister that've created and deployed to the Internet Computer.
