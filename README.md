# Motoko Bootcamp - Deploy your first dApp in 5 minutes!

> Welcome to **Motoko Bootcamp**. This is a guided tutorial to help you deploy your first application on the Internet Computer in 5 minutes. You don't need any prior setup or configuration to use this repository.

## How to get started?

This repository contains a special tool called a **Dev Container**. This is a pre-configured environment that contains all the tools you need to get started with Motoko. <br/>

You can use this environment in two ways:

- **Option 1 (Recommended):** Use the Dev Container in your browser. This is the easiest way to get started. You don't need to install anything. To do that, you need a **GitHub** account, make sure that you are logged in and click on **Code** - **Create Codespace**. This will takes 1-2 minutes before your coding environement is ready.

- **Option 2:** Use theDev Container on your computer. This option requires you to install Docker on your computer and takes more time. If you're interested, read this tutorial.

## Structure of the repository

This repository contains 2 folders:

- **.devcontainer:** This folder contains the configuration of the Dev Container. You don't need to change anything here.
- **src:** This folder contains the source code of the dApps. You will read and write your code here.

Other files include:

- **devcontainer-template.json**: Another configuration file for the Dev Container.
- **LICENSE.md:** The license of this repository.
- **README.md:** This file.
- **dfx.json**: The configuration file for using `dfx` which is a tool we will use to deploy our applications on the Internet Computer.

## Part 1: Use the Demo dApp.

## Part 2: Write your own dApp.

## Part 3: Test your dApp and join us at Motoko Bootcamp for a full week of learning!
